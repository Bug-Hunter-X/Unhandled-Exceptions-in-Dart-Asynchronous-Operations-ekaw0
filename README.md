# Unhandled Exceptions in Dart Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common but easily missed error in Dart: improperly handling exceptions within asynchronous functions.  The `bug.dart` file shows the problematic code, where an exception is caught but not re-thrown, leading to silent failures. The `bugSolution.dart` demonstrates how to correctly re-throw the exception to allow higher-level error handling.

## Problem

In asynchronous operations, exceptions might be caught within a `try-catch` block, but if not re-thrown using `rethrow;`, the error is silently handled, making debugging difficult.  This leads to unexpected behavior and makes it hard to track down the root cause of the failure.

## Solution

The correct approach is to use `rethrow;` in the `catch` block to propagate the exception to the calling function, allowing for a more comprehensive error-handling mechanism. This ensures that errors are properly logged or handled, preventing silent failures and making the application more robust.
